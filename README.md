## Model Providers

This template is configured to use [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) via the [AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/introduction), giving access to many models from different providers through a single API.

### OpenRouter Authentication

Set the `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` environment variable in your `.env.local` (or project environment) to authenticate requests:

```bash
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

You can change the specific model slugs used in `lib/ai/providers.ts` to suit your needs (e.g., `openai/gpt-4o-mini`, `anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet:thinking`, or `openrouter/auto`).

## Deploy Your Own

You can deploy your own version of the Next.js AI Chatbot to Vercel with one click:

## Running locally

You will need to set the following environment variables for the database (Turso/libSQL):

```bash
TURSO_DATABASE_URL=libsql://<your-db>.turso.io
TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN=<your_db_token>
```

It's recommended you use [Vercel Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables) for this, but a `.env.local` file is all that is necessary.

> Note: You should not commit your `.env` file or it will expose secrets that will allow others to control access to your various AI and authentication provider accounts.

1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2. Link local instance with Vercel and GitHub accounts (creates `.vercel` directory): `vercel link`
3. Download your environment variables: `vercel env pull`

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Your app template should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
